/**
 * @notice EIP712 abstract contract for VaultPermissions.
 *
 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP 712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.
 *
 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).
 *
 * A big part of this implementation is inspired from
 * https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol
 *
 * The main difference with OZ is that the "chainid" is not included in the domain separator but in the structHash.
 * The rationale behind is to adapt EIP712 to our cross-chain message signing: allowing a user on chain A to sign
 * a message that will be verified on chain B. If we were to include the "chainid" in the domain separator, that
 * would require the user to switch networks back and forth, because of the limitation:
 * "The user-agent should refuse signing if it does not match the currently active chain.". That would serously
 * deteriorate the UX.
 *
 * Indeed, EIP712 doesn't forbid it as it states that
 * "Protocol designers only need to include the fields that make sense for their signing domain."
 * into the the struct "EIP712Domain". However, we decided to add a ref to "chainid" in the param salt. Together
 * with "chainid" in the typeHash, we assume those provide sufficient security guarantees.
