@title Yearn Gelato Ops
@author yearn.finance
@notice Yearn Gelato Ops or yGO is a smart contract that leverages Gelato to automate
the harvests and tends of strategies that have yGO assigned as its keeper.
The contract provides the Gelato network of keepers Yearn harvest and tend jobs that
are ready to execute, and it pays Gelato after a succesful harvest. The contract detects 
when a new stragegy is using it as its keeper and creates a Gelato harvest job automatically. 
Tend jobs must be added manually.
@dev We use Lens to detect new strategies, but Lens does not include strategies that are
not in a vault's withdrawal queue. This is not expected all the time, but it can happen.
