    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.

    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```solidity
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
